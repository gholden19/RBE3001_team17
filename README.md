## Leb 1: System Architecture and Joint Control

## Lab 2: Forward Kinematics
- Formulate the forward kinematics of the robot arm using DH convention and parameters.
- Create MATLAB scripts and functions to implement your FK calculations.
- Use your FK solution to compute the position of the end effector of the Hephastus Arm using the joint configuration received from the robot, integrating the previously generated code in Lab 1.
- Build a MATLAB stick model and use it for visualizing robot arm motion in real time.
- Implement point-to-point motion between setpoints in the joint space.
- Implement motion following an array of setpoints.
- Visualize and characterize task-space level motion trajectories.
